***Disclaimer:*** This is not a real company as we know this is a dataset compiled by Dahel Consultant Techies for Internship purposes. 


## Introduction

This is Ted Talk Show analysis. It is done by analyzing data from  the TEDTALK table which comprises of TITLE column,	AUTHOR column, DATE column,	VIEWS column,	LIKES column,	and LINK column. I used Excel to get an overview of the dataset before importing it into Power BI where the actual analysis was carried out. 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to know:

- What is the total number of Authors?
- What is the total number of likes and views?
- What is the topic with the highest views and likes
- What is the average likes per views?
- Which of the authors hosted the most talk?
- Trend of views across the year
- What is the correlation between views and likes? 





## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- Power BI concepts like:
   - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations
   - Data Modelling,
   - Measures,
   - Filters,
   - Tooltips,
   - Page buttons,
   - Data visualization

## Data Transformation:

**Step 1:**
- After downloading the dataset, I imported it into POWERBI.

**Step 2:**
- It loaded the dataset authomatically in Power Query Editor but there was no cleaning needed because it was already a cleaned data.

**Step 3:**
- After checking the columns, it was loaded into POWERBI for visualization.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:

Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI or Metrics.
I arrived at a report with a single dashboard consisting of different visuals such as bar chart, line chart, slicer, and KPIs, giving the summary of the insights gained into the company's performance.

## Features of the Report:
The dashboard conveys information about the following key areas:
- Total number of Authors
- Total number of likes and views
- Topic with the highest views and likes
- The average likes per views
- The authors that hosted the most talk
- Trend of views across the year
- Correlation between views and likes

## Analysis

Summary of the insights gained into the chess Game performance: 

- Between January 1, 1970 to February 1 2022, a total number of 5540 Ted Talk was published. 
- It has a total of 341 million likes and 11 billion views.
- The average likes per view is 3.04%
- There’s 4443 Authors between those years with Alex Gendler being the author with the most topics (Authored 45 topics). Iseult Gillespie is the 2nd author with the most ted talk.
- The topic “Do skills kill creativity?” has the highest number of likes and views followed by “your body language may shape who you are” having the second most liked and most viewed 
  topic.
- From the findings there’s a correlation between likes and views, the more the views, the higher the likes. 
- The lowest number of view was in the year 1970 this might be as a result of technology not being widespread then, the highest views happened in the year 2015.


## Recommendation

- More topics should be gotten by the authors that wrote the topics with the most likes and most views (Sir Ken Robinson).

- Moreso, similar topics that is related to the topic that had the most likes and most views should be discussed in the Ted Talk.
